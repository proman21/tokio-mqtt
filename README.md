# tokio-mqtt

**Currently blocked on kabuki!!**

An MQTT client for rust, written for the Tokio framework

## Work in Progress

Currently the backend is a huge mess because I'm moving it to a actor model.
Right now I'm working on kabuki to bring actor system to tokio. Once that work
completes tokio-mqtt will be back on track.
